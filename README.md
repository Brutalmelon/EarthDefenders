# SpaceApps-TheUncrustables

A text adventure app that lets the user (target audience K-9th) decide the best approach to take regarding orbital debris. We built this project to raise awareness for the growing problem of orbital pollution and to invest in education to combat this issue now, rather than waiting for the point of no return.

Our demo project only scratches the surface of its true potential. Future implementation might look like deployment to our educational system, adding complex scenarios from NASA data to provide a deeper learning experience, and monetizing our app through various partnerships to invest in research and education regard orbital debris cleanup.
